In this repository, you will find assignments and seminar materials related to deep learning. The first assignment focuses on MLP (Multilayer Perceptrons), and the second one covers Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The third assignment focuses on RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) and partly on Transformers.
